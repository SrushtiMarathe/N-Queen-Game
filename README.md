# N-Queen Game

Welcome to the N-Queen Game repository! This project provides an interactive solution to the classic N-Queen problem, where the goal is to place N chess queens on an N×N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other.

## About the Project

The N-Queen problem is a well-known puzzle in computer science and mathematics. This repository contains an implementation of the N-Queen solver and an interactive game that allows users to try their own arrangements and learn about the problem. The solution supports boards of arbitrary size (N ≥ 4).

## Features

- Interactive game board to place queens
- Automatic solver for the N-Queen problem
- Visual representation of the board and queen placements
- Option to select board size (N)
- Step-by-step solution viewer
- Reset and clear board functions

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x (if the game is implemented in Python)
- Required dependencies (listed in `requirements.txt` if applicable)


## How to Play

1. Choose the size of the board (N).
2. Place queens on the board by clicking/tapping on empty squares.
3. Try to arrange all N queens so that none attack each other (no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal).
4. Use the solver feature to see a solution or get hints.
5. Reset the board to try again.
